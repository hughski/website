       <p>
       Yes! ColorHug is now officially certified open source hardware by
       <a href="http://certificate.oshwa.org/certification-directory/">OSHWA</a>.
       Our UID is <code>UK000001</code>.
       </p>
       <p>
       The licences chosen for the different parts of the project allow you to copy,
       remix, redesign or repurpose the hardware or even build a device from scratch
       from the hardware plans and the freely downloadable firmware.
       There are no patents or design registrations, nor any intellectual property
       that has to be licenced.
       </p>
       <p>
       There is one small limitation. You can build your own ColorHug device
       and call it a <i>ColorHug</i>, but you cannot use the three color logo as it is a
       trademark of Hughski Limited.
       This was done after taking legal advice to help preserve the community, and to
       stop a company selling a substandard <i>official</i> device that would tarnish
       the brand and make Hughski Limited look bad.

       The above table demonstrates how the Hughski ColorHug compares to other
       similar products on the market.
       The key advantages are the open source licences and open hardware design
       which means you can review and modify all aspects of the product,
       and of course the low price.

       <a name="device-not-working"></a><h3>What do I do if the device stops working?</h3>
       <ul class="default">
        <li>Check the device is plugged in!</li>
        <li>Check <code>dmesg</code> to see if the device is detected, if so check the permissions on the USB device.</li>
        <li>Check the LEDs briefly flash when the device is plugged in.</li>
        <li>Use a different USB cable to the one supplied in order to check whether the cable is at fault.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        If the device does not work, or is otherwise faulty please
        <a href="mailto:colorhug@hughski.com">email us</a> for advice.
        If we agree that the ColorHug is faulty and you return it to us then you
        can request a full refund or a replacement device.

       <a name="shipping-cost"></a><h3>How much is shipping?</h3>
       <p>
       For ColorHug2 and ColorHug+ worldwide tracked/signed-for
       postage is included in the cost of the device.
       </p>
       <p>
       Normally shipping parcels to Europe takes about 4 working days, but has
       been known to take up to two weeks, especially to Italy for some reason.
       Shipping to Africa, Brazil and Russia is meant to take about one week,
       but it seems parcels seem to get lost for weeks at a time and then turn
       up without explanation.
       If the destination is the United States, then double check you've not got
       a letter from the post office about a held package that has to pay some
       kind of customs charge or sales tax.
       </p>
       <p>
       If you've been waiting over two weeks then email me and I can confirm
       the date I sent the parcel and the serial number.
       Our policy on lost or missing parcels is this (which is based on how
       quickly I can file a claim with the UK post office):
       </p>
       <ul class="default">
       <li>If the package was <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 6 weeks from the sent date</li>
       <li>If the package was not <i>signed-for</i> then we have to wait 12 weeks from the sent date</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       If the parcel has not arrived in the durations above, then I can either
       (at your choice) offer you a refund of the full amount via PayPal or
       send another parcel <b>to a different address</b>.
       If this second delivery also fails, then I can't attempt to send any more,
       and only a refund will be offered.

       <a name="leds"></a><h3>What do the LEDs mean?</h3>
       <p>
       There are two LEDs in the ColorHug, one green and one red.
       The LEDs are used in the following way:
       </p>
       <ul class="default">
       <li>Both LEDs flash on then off for a split second when the hardware is plugged in.</li>
       <li>The green LED flashes quickly three times when the sensor is locked.</li>
       <li>The red and green LEDs flash slowly alternately when the device is in bootloader mode and needs reflashing with new firmware.</li>
       <li>The red LED displays morse code in the event of a fatal device error.</li>
       </ul>

       <a name="matching-displays"></a><h3>Can I make my external display match my laptop screen?</h3>
       <p>
       You can certainly get close, but you really don't want to if you don't have to.
       Imagine buying a $45,000 Ferrari with a 2 liter engine, and another $70,000
       Ferrari with a 4 liter engine.
       You want <i>the performance to match between the two cars</i>.
       The only way to do this would be to make the 4 liter car much less powerful
       so that it matches the performance of the 2 liter car.
       In the context of display calibration you would be limiting the better screen to the
       range of colors the less expensive screen can display.
       </p>
       <p>
       There are also other issues for making the displays "match".
       Imagine if the laptop screen ouput approximately a red primary of 620nm,
       and the external screen output a primary of 630nm.
       You can't change the primary as it's due to the chemical composition of screen hardware.
       You can emulate different XYZ colors using color mixed from other channels,
       but you can mix colors to make a pink red a deep red.
       </p>
       <p>
       What you can do with a colorimeter is give each screen a similar whitepoint value,
       which gets you 90% the way there as your eyes are very sensitive to
       whitepoint <i>differences</i> (but not absolute values).
       The ColorHug software defauts to a D65 whitepoint, although you can choose
       a custom whitepoint using dispcalGUI.
       </p>

       <hr/>
       <a name="display-printer"></a><h3>Can I make my display match what is printed?</h3>
       <p>
       This is a complex problem indeed, and design companies pay tens of
       thousands of pounds trying to make this a reality.
       From a technical level, it's really really hard.
       Screens are outputting photons (additive, emissive), and the color is affected by
       things like the ambient level of lighting the room and even the color the
       room is painted affects the color you see.
       Paper depends on the color and spectra of the lighting you are using (subtractive, reflective) to
       view the printed sheet, the ink, the paper color, the paper quality, and
       many more things.
       I would suggest any one more interested in this difficult problem reads
       <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-World-Color-Management-Industrial-Strength/dp/0321267222">Real World Color Management</a>
       which explains a lot of these problems better than I ever can.
       </p>
       <p>
       One thing the ColorHug can do is fix your display so that at least we're
       more in control of the display side of the equation.
       It's not going to make the resulting edited hardcopies any <i>less</i> accurate,
       and will hopefully be more accurate. You can be sure of one thing,
       it's certainly never going to match perfectly. :)
       </p>

       <hr/>
       <a name="crapcal"></a><a name="colorcast"></a><h3>Why is my screen "wrong" after calibrating?</h3>
       <p>
       If your screen differs much from the idealized sRGB that the ColorHug
       is calibrated against then the calibration result may be far from ideal.
       This may happen if you are using an expensive LED display, or a
       miniature embedded LCD with low bit depth
       <acronym title="Digital-to-analog converter">DAC</acronym>.
       </p>
       <p>
       To fix this, you just need to load a correction matrix that's close to
       your display technology using the <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> GUI program.
       At the moment there are not many display types, but this will increase
       when those in the ColorHug community with a photospectrometer start
       contributing matrices. It's a typical chicken and egg problem, although
       if you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/colorhug-users" target="_blank">colorhug-users</a>
       google group I'll announce new matrices when they are uploaded.
       </p>
       <p>
       If you've already got a photospectrometer (or can borrow one for a few
       hours) then please follow the directions <a href="calibrate.html">here</a>.
       If you contribute the resulting
       <acronym title="colorimeter correction matrix">CCMX</acronym> file back to us, we can share it with
       other users and improve their calibration result too.
       I'm especially interested in odd display types, as these will be very
       different from the calibration target.
       </p>

       <hr/>
       <a name="locationicc"></a><h3>Where is the .icc file stored after I've calibrated?</h3>
       <p>
       After calibrating with the GNOME wizard the file is saved in 
       <code>/home/liveuser/.local/share/icc/</code> - in the next version of the
       LiveUSB we're going to add the ability to save to the LiveUSB device itself.
       </p>

       <hr/>
       <a name="firmware-update-data"></a><h3>What data is transmitted to hughski.com?</h3>
       <p>
       If you choose to update the firmware on your device, the <code>fwupd</code>
       program contacts the LVFS and downloads the list of all the firmware updates.
       Only your IP address is sent to the server, no hardware details are sent at all.
       The <b>only</b> time any other data is transfered to the server is when you
       update the firmware or download new CCMX matrices.
       </p>

       <a name="erase-factory-cal"></a><h3>I've erased my factory calibration!</h3>
       <p>
       If you're got colorhug-client 0.1.4 or newer installed, just run
       <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> and you should be presented with the following
       dialog:
       </p>
       <img src="img/colorhug-ccmx-fix.png" class="centered" alt="[colorhug-ccmx screenshot]"/>
       <p>
       Then just click <code>Repair</code> and the device will be back to normal.
       </p>

       <hr/>
       <a name="bugzilla"></a><h3>I've found a bug or missing feature, what do I do?</h3>
       <p>
       Just file a bug in the correct <a href="https://github.com/hughski">issue tracker</a>.
       Be sure to write as much detail as possible in the bug report, for instance:
       </p>
       <ul class="default">
       <li><code>lsusb -v</code></li>
       <li><code>uname -r</code></li>

       <li><code>colorhug-cmd get-hardware-version</code></li>
       <li><code>colorhug-cmd get-serial-number</code></li>
       <li><code>colorhug-cmd get-calibration-map</code></li>
       <li><code>colorhug-cmd list-calibration</code></li>
       </ul>

       <hr/>
       <a name="flashing-failed"></a><h3>Flashing failed, is my device now a brick!?</h3>
       <p>
       No.
       If the flashing failed (of if the new firmware is bad), the ColorHug
       device reverts to a safe startup mode.
       The bootloader is always loaded at every startup, and the firmware is
       only bootstrapped if it is marked as valid.
       The easiest way to tell if you are in bootloader mode is to
       <a href="#leds">look at the LEDs</a> or search for a line like this in
       <code>dmesg</code>:
       </p>
<pre>
[  276.933714] generic-usb 0003:04D8:F8DA.0003:
  hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Hughski Ltd. ColorHug (bootloader)]
</pre>
       <p>
       The easiest thing to do is just to reattempt to update the flash, by
       running <code>colorhug-flash</code> again.
       If this again fails, just manually boot the firmware like this:
       </p>
<pre>
$ colorhug-cmd boot-flash
$ colorhug-cmd set-flash-success 1
</pre>

       <a name="windows-and-osx"></a><h3>Does the device work on Windows or OS&nbsp;X?</h3>
       <p>
        The ColorHug can be used on Windows and Apple computers using the LiveCD
        and then copying the <code>.icc</code> profile to the destination operating system.
        I can't do native device drivers myself, although a few people have said
        informally they wanted to work on them.
        The device uses the USB <acronym title="Human interface device">HID</acronym>
        protocol, so no <i>digitally signed</i> device drivers should be
        required at all.

       <a name="solaris-and-bsds"></a><h3>Does the device work on Solaris and FreeBSD?</h3>
       <p>
        There are no plans to support this device on any version of Unix or
        any of the BSD variants.

       <a name="old-mac"></a><h3>The LiveCD doesn't work on my old Mac!</h3>
       <p>
        If you have an Mac older than 2006 you have an old
        <acronym title="Extensible Firmware Interface">EFI</acronym> on your system.
        You can not upgrade this and normal Linux distribution CDs will not work.
        Some distributions have been specially modified to work with this type
        of system.
        A special Ubuntu distribution exists for this hardware called
        <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/">Ubuntu x64_mac</a>
        and you can use the
        <a href="https://launchpad.net/~pmjdebruijn/+archive/gcm-colorhug/">Ubuntu PPA</a>
        to update to the newest firmware.
       </p>

       <a name="projector"></a><h3>How do I use the ColorHug with a projector?</h3>
       <p>
       Shine the projector onto the ColorHug in a dark room from about
       1-2&nbsp;meters away so there is no shadow.
       Ensure the ColorHug's aperture is pointing straight towards the center
       of the colored patches.
       To increase the sensitivity of the ColorHug, you can remove the aperture
       hole assembly using a fingernail tucked between the two rubber grommits,
       although then the room will have to be completely dark.
       </p>

       <a name="need-env-var"></a><h3>Why does the ColorHug not work with ArgyllCMS?</h3>
       <p>
       To use the ColorHug with the ArgyllCMS tools on the command line ensure
       you have set <code>ENABLE_COLORHUG=1</code> as an environment variable.
       This is required because the ColorHug currently doesn't work reliably
       across all platforms ArgyllCMS supports.
       This is of course set automatically when using the graphical tools.
       </p>

       <hr/>
       <a name="software-versions"></a><h3>What are the minimum software versions?</h3>
       <p>
       If you're not using the LiveCD you need at least:
       </p>
       <ul class="default">
       <li><code>argyllcms</code> (Fedora) or <code>argyll</code> (Ubuntu) >= 1.4.0</li>
       <li><code>colord</code> >= 0.1.15</li>
       <li><code>colorhug-client</code> >= 0.1.4</li>
       <li><code>gusb</code> >= 0.1.2</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       If you're using GNOME, also add:
       </p>
       <ul class="default">
       <li><code>gnome-color-manager</code> >= 3.2.4</li>
       <li><code>gnome-control-center</code> >= 3.2.2</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       If you're using KDE, also add:
       </p>
       <ul class="default">
       <li><code>colord-kde</code></li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       If you're using XFCE or another desktop environment then you can of
       course just install <code>colorhug-client</code> to update firmware
       and load CCMX files. If you want to use the calibration wizard you can
       either install the GNOME dependencies or install the very advanced
       program dispcalGUI, although we can't support that ourselves.
       </p>

       <a name="red-shift"></a><h3>Why has my display got an obvious color shift after calibration?</h3>
       <p>
       Calibrating to a warmer temperature of D65 is going to look a lot more
       blue than is native for some displays.
       If the color shift is obviously really wrong, take a look at this
       <a href="http://blog.pcode.nl/2012/06/15/colorhug-red-shift-workaround/">
       excellent blog post</a> by Pascal.
       Usually selecting a closer CCMX in <code>colorhug-ccmx</code> is the solution.
       We're working on the firmware design, and the device accuracy for low
       light is going up all the time, but this is a problem that affects all
       colorimeter devices.
