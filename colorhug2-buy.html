         <h2>Buy your own ColorHug2 for &pound;85</h2>

         <p>
          We are a small company and unfortunately we don't directly accept
          credit cards, checks, bankers drafts or cash.
          Please use PayPal or BACS to complete the purchase.
          There are no long legal terms and conditions pages to read.
          Please <b>only</b> order this product if:
         </p>
         <ul class="default">
          <li>
           You agree Hughski Ltd. can't be held responsible if your computer is
           damaged or stops working after using the LiveUSB or ColorHug2.
           Note: The ColorHug is a 5 Volt USB device, so it is highly unlikely to cause damage of any kind.
           The LiveCD also deliberately has no installer, so should be very safe.
          </li>
          <li>
           You will have to pay any applicable customs charges or import taxes when
           we send the ColorHug to any country which is outside of Europe.
           The label will state the value of the object is £85 and is described as
           <i>Color calibration hardware</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
           You understand there are <b>no Microsoft Windows or Apple OS&nbsp;X
           native drivers</b> included with this product.
           You can use the Linux LiveCD sent with the device on any modern PC.
           The <code>display.icc</code> file can then be saved and used with Linux,
           Mac or Windows.
          </li>
         </ul>
